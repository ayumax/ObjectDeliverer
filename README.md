If you acquire this plugin through the Marketplace, you will be charged the specified fee.

## Description
ObjectDeliverer is a data transmission / reception library for Unreal Engine (C ++, Blueprint).

This is especially helpful when using raw TCP/IP or UDP communication. Depending on the situation, itâ€™s also easy to switch the protocol from TCP/IP to UDP.

It has the following features.

+ Communication protocol, data division rule, serialization method can be switched by part replacement.
+ Available for both C ++ and Blueprint

## Relationship between branch and UE Engine version

The master branch is configured to be built with the latest version of Unreal Engine.

If you want to use an older version of UE, please use the branch named after that version (for example, UE5.4 branch for v5.4).

However, the older version branches may not have the latest updates applied. If you want to use the latest features on an older version of UE, you will need to obtain the master branch and then modify it so it can be built with the older UE.


## Communication protocol
The following protocols can be used with built-in.
You can also add your own protocol.
+ TCP/IP Server(Connectable to multiple clients)
+ TCP/IP Client
+ UDP(Sender)
+ UDP(Receiver)
+ Shared Memory(Windows Only)
+ File Writer
+ File Reader

## Data division rule
The following rules are available for built-in split rules of transmitted and received data.

This functionality primarily divides received buffers into appropriate packets, but also plays an important role in reassembling packets that were split across multiple buffers. 

This is especially useful for TCP/IP connections where a single transmission may be fragmented into multiple buffers during network transport.

+ FixedSize  
	Example) In the case of fixed 1024 bytes

+ Header(BodySize) + Body  
	Example) When the size area is 4 bytes  
	![sizeandbody](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8191970/56475796-6e672100-64c8-11e9-8cf0-6524f2899be0.png)


+ Split by terminal symbol  
	Example) When 0x00 is the end
	![terminate](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8191970/56475740-82f6e980-64c7-11e9-91a6-05d77cfdbd60.png)

+ No division  
    Uses the received buffer as-is without any packet splitting or combining operations.

## Serialization method
+ Byte Array
+ UTF-8 string
+ Object(Json)

# Installation
+ Please clone this repository
+ Please copy the Plugins directory to the project folder
+ Please activate ObjectDeliverer from Plugins after launching editor

# Quick Start
1. Create an ObjectDelivererManager
1. Create a DeliveryBox(If you wish to send and receive data other than binary)
1. Set the send / receive protocol and PacketRule, then start the ObjectDelivererManager

```cpp
void UMyClass::Start()
{
    auto deliverer = UObjectDelivererManager::CreateObjectDelivererManager();

    // bind connected event
    deliverer->Connected.AddDynamic(this, &UMyClass::OnConnect);
    // bind disconnected event
    deliverer->Disconnected.AddDynamic(this, &UMyClass::OnDisConnect);
    // bind receive event
    deliverer->ReceiveData.AddDynamic(this, &UMyClass::OnReceive);

    // start deliverer
    // + protocol : TCP/IP Server
    // + Data division rule : Header(BodySize) + Body
    // + Serialization method : Byte Array
    deliverer->Start(UProtocolFactory::CreateProtocolTcpIpServer(9099),
                     UPacketRuleFactory::CreatePacketRuleSizeBody());
}

void UMyClass::OnConnect(UObjectDelivererProtocol* ClientSocket)
{
    // send data
    TArray<uint8> buffer;
    deliverer->Send(buffer);
}

void UMyClass::OnDisConnect(UObjectDelivererProtocol* ClientSocket)
{
    // closed
    UE_LOG(LogTemp, Log, TEXT("closed"));
}

void UMyClass::OnReceive(UObjectDelivererProtocol* ClientSocket, const TArray<uint8>& Buffer)
{
    // received data buffer
}
```
